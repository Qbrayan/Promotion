# Problem Statement

A client  want us to identify the right person for a promotion. Currently, this process consists of several steps:

1.They first identify a set of employees based on recommendations and past performance

2.Selected employees go through the separate training and evaluation program for each vertical. These programs are based on the required skill of each vertical

3.At the end of the program, based on various factors such as training performance, KPI completion (only employees with KPIs completed greater than 60% are considered for promotion.)
